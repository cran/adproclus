allocation for first run. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\description{
Perform \strong{low dimensional} additive profile clustering (ADPROCLUS) on
object by variable data. Use case: data to cluster consists of a large set of
variables, where it can be useful to interpret the cluster profiles in terms
of a smaller set of components that represent the original variables well.
}
\details{
In this function, an extension by Depril et al. (2012) of
Mirkins (1987, 1990) additive profile clustering method is used to obtain a
low dimensional overlapping clustering model of the object by variable data
provided by \code{data}.
More precisely, the low dimensional ADPROCLUS model approximates an
\eqn{I \times J} object by variable data matrix \eqn{X} by an
\eqn{I \times J} model matrix \eqn{M}. For \eqn{K} overlapping
clusters, \eqn{M} can be decomposed into an \eqn{I \times K}
binary cluster membership matrix \eqn{A} and a \eqn{K \times J}
real-valued cluster profile matrix \eqn{P} s.t. \eqn{M = AP.}
With the simultaneous dimension reduction, \eqn{P} is restricted
to be of reduced rank \eqn{S < min(K,J)}, such that it can be decomposed
into \eqn{P = CB',} with \eqn{C} a \eqn{K \times S} matrix and
\eqn{B} a \eqn{J \times S} matrix. Now, a row in
\eqn{C} represents the profile values associated with the
respective cluster in terms of the \eqn{S} components, while
the entries of \eqn{B} can be used to interpret the components
in terms of the complete set of variables. In particular, the aim of an
ADPROCLUS analysis is therefore, given a number of clusters \eqn{K} and a
number of dimensions \eqn{S}, to estimate a model matrix \eqn{M}
that reconstructs data matrix
\eqn{X} as close as possible in a least squares sense and
simultaneously reduce the dimensions of the data.
For a detailed illustration of the low dimensional ADPROCLUS model and
associated loss function, see Depril et al. (2012).

\strong{Warning:} Computation time increases exponentially with increasing
number of clusters, \eqn{K}. We recommend to determine the computation time
of a single start for each specific dataset and \eqn{K} before increasing the
number of starts.
